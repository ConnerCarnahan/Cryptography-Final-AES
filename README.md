# Cryptography-Final-AES
Conner Carnahan


This is a working program which performs the AES protocol on a 128 bit number.
This is functional as AES 128, 192, and 256 for both Ciphering and Deciphering.

You can Check the documentation: https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/197/final/documents/fips-197.pdf
To see that the output states are in fact the correct the state examples are on pages 35-46.
